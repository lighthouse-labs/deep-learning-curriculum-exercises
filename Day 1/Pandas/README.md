# Welcome to Pandas Tutorial

It is the updated version of [**Brandon’s Pandas Tutorial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw) from 2015. One of the best Pandas tutorials out there (even creators of this course went through this tutorial :)).

The first instance of this tutorial was delivered at PyCon 2015 in Montréal.

The data for the tutorial can be downloaded from [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NY6cmF9Shjw-dD7BD6bNmfcIVz-kQcFR/view?usp=sharing).
